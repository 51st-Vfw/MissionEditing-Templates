# 51st VFW Templates

This repository contains several different templates to help with mission design.

## Mission Template

This repository contains a template mission from the 51st VFW for use by mission designers as
a starting point. The template is not a complete mission, but instead provides a starting point
based on the
[51st VFW SOPs](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/MissionEditing-Index/blob/master/documentation/missionsEditingSOPs.md).
The template is found in `VFW51_Core_Mission` directory and supports all of the maps listed in
the following table.

|Abbreviation|Map Name|
|:----------:|---|
|CAU|Caucasus|
|MAR|Marianas|
|NTTR|Nevada Test and Training Range|
|PG|Persian Gulf|
|SYR|Syria|

To use the template and set it up for a particular map, see the Quick Start Guide in the
[51st VFW Workflow documentation](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/MissionEditing-Index/blob/master/documentation/me_workflow.md).
This documentation also provides further details on the operation of the workflow in general.

Included in the `VFW51_Core_Mission` directory are a number of `Tmplt_<map>_Core.miz` mission
packages (one for each of the supported maps from the above table) that provide baseline mission
templates. These templates are setup by the workflow and are not usable on their own.

In addition to the repository version, a `.zip` 

## Kneeboard Templates

The repository contains a set of `.svg` 
[templates](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/MissionEditing-Templates/tree/master/Kboard_Templates)
for kneeboards that are aligned with the
[51st VFW Mission SOPs](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/MissionEditing-Index).
These templates include common comms cards along with some per-airframe cards. Most vector
graphics programs provide the ability to edit `.svg` files and export the results as `.png`
or `.jpg` suitable for use as mission kneeboards.
