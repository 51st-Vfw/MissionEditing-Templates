# 51st VFW Core Mission Template

> This is the base 51st VFW mission template supporting the Caucusas, Marianas, NTTR, Persian
> Gulf, and Syria maps. The template uses the 51st VFW workflow the
> [`workflow.md`](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/MissionEditing-Templates/blob/main/VFW51_Core_Mission/workflow.md)
> document describes. The template includes default setup for all 51st VFW airframes and
> flights, support flights, and carrier groups per 
> [51st VFW SOPs](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/MissionEditing-Index/blob/master/documentation/missionsEditingSOPs.md).
> These units will need to be positioned (or deleted) according to the needs of the mission. The
> template sets up the scripting environment by loading the following frameworks at mission
> start,
> [MOOSE](https://github.com/FlightControl-Master/MOOSE/),
> [Skynet](https://github.com/walder/Skynet-IADS),
> [mist](https://github.com/mrSkortch/MissionScriptingTools),
> [51st VFW MapSOP](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/MissionEditing-Index/blob/master/51stMapSOP/readme.md).

> Missions are encouraged to include a readme with similar structure to the outline below. This
> content will change based on the specifics of the mission.
